# **EJS *(Embedded JavaScript templating)***


- EJS stands for Embedded Javascript

- EJS allows you to skip the app.js file and allow the index or whatever file you dictate to access the server.js directly

- EJS allows you to also enter js directly into the index file to iterate over objects using for loops, if/else statements etc

- this allows you to access information from a database or API and directly insert that information on the html file without having to push it to an app.js file then to the index file.
