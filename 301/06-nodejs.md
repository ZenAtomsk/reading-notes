## What Is Node.js?

Node.js is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome’s V8 JavaScript engine. an event-based, non-blocking, asynchronous I/O runtime that uses Google’s V8 JavaScript engine and libuv library

The V8 engine is the open-source JavaScript engine that runs in Google Chrome and other Chromium-based web browsers, including Brave, Opera, and Vivaldi. It was designed with performance in mind and is responsible for compiling JavaScript directly to native machine code that your computer can execute.

However, when we say that Node is built on the V8 engine, we don’t mean that Node programs are executed in a browser. They aren’t. Rather, the creator of Node (Ryan Dahl) took the V8 engine and enhanced it with various features, such as a file system API, an HTTP library, and a number of operating system–related utility methods.

This means that Node.js is a program we can use to execute JavaScript on our computers. In other words, it’s a JavaScript runtime

## Node Binaries vs Version Manager

Many websites will recommend that you head to the official Node download page and grab the Node binaries for your system. While that works, I would suggest that you use a version manager instead. This is a program that allows you to install multiple versions of Node and switch between them at will. There are various advantages to using a version manager. For example, it negates potential permission issues when using Node with npm and lets you set a Node version on a per-project basis.

If you fancy going the version manager route, please consult our quick tip: Install Multiple Versions of Node.js using nvm. Otherwise, grab the correct binaries for your system from the link above and install those.

As can be seen on this compatibility table, Node has excellent support for ECMAScript 2015 (ES6) and beyond. As you’re only targeting one runtime (a specific version of the V8 engine), this means that you can write your JavaScript using the latest and most modern syntax. It also means that you don’t generally have to worry about compatibility issues — as you would if you were writing JavaScript that would run in different browsers.

## Introducing npm, the JavaScript Package Manager

To check which version you have installed on your system, type npm -v.

In addition to being the package manager for JavaScript, npm is also the world’s largest software registry. There are over 1,000,000 packages of JavaScript code available to download, with billions of downloads per week. Let’s take a quick look at how we would use npm to install a package

## Working with the package.json File

If you look at the contents of the test directory, you’ll notice a folder entitled node_modules. This is where npm has saved lodash and any libraries that lodash depends on. The node_modules folder shouldn’t be checked in to version control, and can, in fact, be re-created at any time by running npm install from within the project’s root.

If you open the package.json file, you’ll see lodash listed under the dependencies field. By specifying your project’s dependencies in this way, you allow any developer anywhere to clone your project and use npm to install whatever packages it needs to run.

## What Is Node.js Used For?

Now that we know what Node and npm are and how to install them, we can turn our attention to the first of their common uses: installing (via npm) and running (via Node) various build tools — designed to automate the process of developing a modern JavaScript application.

These build tools come in all shapes and sizes, and you won’t get far in a modern JavaScript landscape without bumping into them. They can be used for anything from bundling your JavaScript files and dependencies into static assets, to running tests, or automatic code linting and style checking.

## Node.js Lets Us Run JavaScript on the Server

Next we come to one of the biggest use cases for Node.js — running JavaScript on the server. This isn’t a new concept, and was first attempted by Netscape way back in 1994. Node.js, however, is the first implementation to gain any real traction, and it provides some unique benefits, compared to traditional languages.

## The Node.js Execution Model

In very simplistic terms, when you connect to a traditional server, such as Apache, it will spawn a new thread to handle the request. In a language such as PHP or Ruby, any subsequent I/O operations (for example, interacting with a database) block the execution of your code until the operation has completed. That is, the server has to wait for the database lookup to complete before it can move on to processing the result. If new requests come in while this is happening, the server will spawn new threads to deal with them. This is potentially inefficient, as a large number of threads can cause a system to become sluggish — and, in the worst case, for the site to go down. The most common way to support more connections is to add more servers.

Node.js, however, is single-threaded. It’s also event-driven, which means that everything that happens in Node is in reaction to an event. For example, when a new request comes in (one kind of event) the server will start processing it. If it then encounters a blocking I/O operation, instead of waiting for this to complete, it will register a callback before continuing to process the next event. When the I/O operation has finished (another kind of event), the server will execute the callback and continue working on the original request. Under the hood, Node uses the libuv library to implement this asynchronous (that is, non-blocking) behavior.

Node’s execution model causes the server very little overhead, and consequently it’s capable of handling a large number of simultaneous connections. The traditional approach to scaling a Node app is to clone it and have the cloned instances share the workload. Node.js even has a built-in module to help you implement a cloning strategy on a single server.

## Are There Any Downsides?

The fact that Node runs in a single thread does impose some limitations. For example, blocking I/O calls should be avoided, CPU-intensive operations should be handed off to a worker thread, and errors should always be handled correctly for fear of crashing the entire process.

Some developers also dislike the callback-based style of coding that JavaScript imposes (so much so that there’s even a site dedicated to the horrors of writing asynchronous JavaScript). But with the arrival of native Promises, followed closely by async await, flow control in modern JavaScript has become easier than it ever was.
