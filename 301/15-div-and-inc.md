I'm kind of salty about this one. One of the least represented ethnicities (Latino) is being excluded. I've spoken to a few other people, ethnic and not, and they were given much larger percentages for tuition scholarships. I've known my entire life how this country works and a lot of preaching equality happens, but not much action. Such is life as a minority.
