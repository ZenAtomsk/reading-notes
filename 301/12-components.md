## **PARTIALS**

Partials come in handy when you want to reuse the same HTML across multiple views. Think of partials as functions, they make large websites easier to maintain as you donâ€™t have to go and change a piece of text in every page it appears in. Instead, you define that reusable bundle of code in a file and include it wherever you need it.

- in a new "views/partials" file create the partial html
- to include the partial file in another ejs use <%-include(PARTIAL_FILE_NAME)%>
- partials are native to ejs, so easy to put in
