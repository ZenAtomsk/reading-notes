## **How to Solve Programming Problems**

### **Common mistakes**

improper allocation of time

You really want to make sure you take enough time to understand the problem completely before attempting to solve it.

#### **A simple set of steps**

1. Read the problem completely twice.
2. Solve the problem manually with 3 sets of sample data.
3. Optimize the manual steps.
4. Write the manual steps as comments or pseudo-code.
5. Replace the comments or pseudo-code with real code.
6. Optimize the real code.

The only way you are going to have confidence in this process is to practice it. 

Many times you will find that a problem itself involves multiple large steps or is very complicated.  In those instances, you will want to try and find a way to cut the problem directly in half and then following the process above for each half.

### **How I felt about this article**

It can be summed up by the title. It has no answers to why or how. It's like telling poor people to stop being poor. What a poorly written article.

## **How to think like a programmer — lessons in problem solving**

Essentially, it’s all about a more effective way for problem solving.

Problem solving is the meta-skill.

The best way to solve a problem involves
1. having a framework
2. practicing it

### **Framework**

1. Understand - Know exactly what is being asked. 
2. Plan - Plan your solution!
3. Divide - Do not try to solve one big problem. break it into sub-problems
4. Stuck?
    - Debug
    - Reassess
    - Research

### **Practice**

Practice. Practice. Practice. Practice. Practice. Practice. Practice. Practice. Practice. Practice. Practice. Practice. Practice. Practice. Practice. Practice. Practice. Practice. Practice. Practice. Practice. Practice. Practice. Practice.

Chess puzzles, math problems, Sudoku, Go, Monopoly, video-games, cryptokitties, etc

## **The 5 Whys**

when a problem occurs, you drill down to its root cause by asking "Why?" five times. Then, when a counter-measure becomes apparent, you follow it through to prevent the issue from recurring.

You can use 5 Whys for troubleshooting, quality improvement, and problem solving, but it is most effective when used to resolve simple or moderately difficult problems.

### **How to Use the 5 Whys**

1. **Assemble a Team** - Gather together people who are familiar with the specifics of the problem

2. **Define the Problem** - If you can, observe the problem in action. Discuss it with your team and write a brief, clear problem statement that you all agree on. write your statement on a whiteboard or sticky note, leaving enough space around it to add your answers to the repeated question, "Why?"

3. **Ask the First "Why?"** - Ask your team why the problem is occurring. Search for answers that are grounded in fact: they must be accounts of things that have actually happened, not guesses at what might have happened.

4. **Ask "Why?" Four More Times** - For each of the answers that you generated in Step 3, ask four further "whys" in succession. Each time, frame the question in response to the answer you've just recorded.

5. **Know When to Stop** - You'll know that you've revealed the root cause of the problem when asking "why" produces no more useful responses, and you can go no further.

6. **Address the Root Cause(s)** - discuss and agree on the counter-measures that will prevent the problem from recurring.

7. **Monitor Your Measures** - Keep a close watch on how effectively your counter-measures eliminate or minimize the initial problem. You may need to amend them, or replace them entirely. If this happens, it's a good idea to repeat the 5 Whys process to ensure that you've identified the correct root cause.
