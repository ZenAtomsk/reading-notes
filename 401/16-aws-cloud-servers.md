## Research

1. **Whatâ€™s the difference between a FIFO and a standard queue?**

    FIFO queues have essentially the same features as standard queues, but provide the added benefits of supporting ordering and exactly-once processing. FIFO queues provide additional features that help prevent unintentional duplicates from being sent by message producers or from being received by message consumers.

2. **How can the server be assured a message was properly received?**

    Store them

3. **What classic design pattern is best represented by event driven programming?**

    object oriented design

4. **How do you test an event driven system?**

    tests for the functions or by emitting events
