## **Code 401 - Advanced Software Development**

## **_Objective_**

At the end of this course, you will be able to:

- Build and contribute to a server-side and client-side application, each using an architecture/framework that promotes maintainability, scalability, and collaboration. These skills will be fully demonstrated during project week during their team development of a prototype, adhering to industry best practices and patterns.

- Apply Computer Science fundamentals in analyzing the trade-offs between competing solutions when choosing algorithms; JavaScript coding patterns and practices; and byte formats that do not degrade the performance or Node browser functionality of their applications.

- Given a series of professional development workshops and the web development knowledge, experience, habits, and practices learned in this course, students will create an online brand, network, and resume; and will demonstrate aptitude in personal and technical interviews of varying formats, in order to conduct a successful job search and obtain a job as a Full-Stack JavaScript or Front-End Web Developer.
