# Component Composition

## Review, Research, and Discussion

1. **Can a parent component access the state of a child component?**

- yes, if a ref is created in the parent

2. **What can be passed along in a prop variable?**

- data types, functions..not sure what else. Probably a lot more.

3. **How can a child component “know” the state of another component?**

- with a reference to it passed as a prop

## Vocabulary

- [**component props**](https://www.w3schools.com/react/react_props.asp) - Props are arguments passed into React components. Props are passed to components via HTML attributes.
- **component state** - store property values that belongs to the component. When the state object changes, the component re-renders.
- **application state** - the interface between your data from any kind of backend or local change and the representation of this data with UI-elements in the frontend.
