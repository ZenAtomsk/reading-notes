# Javascript

## How HTML, CSS and Javascript  fit together

Web developers usually talk about three languages that are used to create web pages: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
*each language forms a separate layer with different purpose. Each layer, builds on the previous one.

1. **Content Layer** *.html files*
    - this is where the content of the page lives. The HTML gives the page structure and adds semantics.

2. **Presentation Layer** *.css files*
    - The CSS enhances the HTML page with the rules that state how the HTML content is presented (backgrounds, borders, box dimensions, colors, fonts, etc.).

3. **Behavior layer** *.js files*
    - This is where we can change how the page behaves, adding interactivity. We will aim to keep as much of our JS as possible in separate files.

## Progressive enhancement

These three layers form the basis of a popular approach to building web pages called progressive enhancement.

## Creating a basic JAVASCRIPT

JavaScript is written in plain text, just like HTML and CSS, so you do not need any new tools to write a script.
