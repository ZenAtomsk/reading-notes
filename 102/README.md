## These are my reading notes


## Growth mindset is accomplishing short term goals for long term progress!
- Dive in and *just keep swimming*
- Making an effort; a partially constructed bridge would be a nightmare

### My ~~name~~ is Ricardo. I was sick of living in deserts, so my partner and I moved to the Seattle area knowing only each other here. I enjoy learning new things, playing sports and building things.   [GitHub](https://github.com/ZenAtomsk)
