# Computer architecture and logic

## *How do computers work*

### **What makes a computer a computer**

used to manipulate information

4 tasks
- take input - the stuff that you do that makes the computer do stuff
- store information - processor takes info from memory, manipulates with algorithm then sends processed info back to memory until processed info is ready to be output
- process it - using an algorith (set of commands)
output the results - text/photos/videos/games/vr/signals

*output from one computer is the input for others when connected*

*common to all computers*

### **Binary and data**

almost nobody today deals directly with 1's and 0's

wires and curcuits that carry info in a computer.

elecricity works as an on/off signal per wire (bit)
more wires = more bits

The binary number system 0 and 1

each position carries a value. multiply by two for each step

Position value (position x 2) | 16 | 8 | 4 | 2 | 1 |
--- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
Binary code | 1 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 
example |  (1x16) | (1x8)  | (0x4)  | (0x2) | (1x1) | 
Value of position code | 16 | 8 | 0 | 0 | 1 |
*Value of binary code = Total value of postional code added together*
<p> 11001 = 16 + 8 + 0 + 0 + 1 = 25 </p> 

text images and sound can also be represented

numbers can be assigned to a letter

imiges are displayed in pixels, each pixel can be represented as a number with RGB 

sound is vibration. vibrations can be represented as a waveform. any point on the waveform can be represented as a number. for higher quality sound a higher bit rate is used.
more bits means a higher range of numbers or more details.

### **Circuits and Logic**

every input or output is a type of info that can be represented in binary code

in order to process input into output. computer needs to modify and combine input symbols.

### **Memory, CPU, Input and Output**

Input converts physical input to binary information

Memory stores information

CPU *Central Processing Unit* calculates information

Output Devices converts information to physical output

Input to output

keystorke on keyboard converts as binary into the computer. cpu calculates how to diplay pixel by pixel. cpu requests from memeory how to draw. cpu runs instructions and stores how to display in memory. pixel info sent in binary to output. 

### **Hardware and Software**

Hardware:
- circuits
- chips
- wires
- speakers
- plugs
- stuff

Software
- apps
- games
- websites
- maps
- creative
- analysis

CPU receives simple commands that tell it which circuit to use

Binary code is the most basic form of software. Everything can be processed in binary.

OS *Operating System* is the master program that manages how software uses the hardware of a computer

OS controls other software. decides what program can use the cpu.
